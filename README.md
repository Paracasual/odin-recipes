# Recipes Website (paracasual@github)
## 

This is my first ever project in web development via the open source cirriculum, The Odin Project. The objective of this project is to create a website with a homepage which includes links to various recipes. The experience I wish to gain from completing this project will provide me with an adequate understanding of the basics of HTML and will aid me in my journey to becoming a professional web developer.
As I become more proficient in web development I will gradually add more features and content to the website. For now, I am very satisfied with what I've accomplished.
